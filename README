#Project1 Skeleton multiple processes
Submitted By: Saleem Thapa

Description:

This project demonstrates multi-process management in a Unix environment using C programming. 
It consists of two main components: oss (the parent process) and user(the child process). oss is responsible for launching
and managing multiple user processes with specific parameters.

Compilation:

-> Ensure you have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your system.

-> Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory where oss.c, worker.c, and the Makefile are located.

To compile the project, run the following command:

-> Type command "make" This will compile both oss.c and user.c and generate the oss and user executables.

Running the Program: 

type "./oss -n <total_children> -s <simultaneous_children> -t <iteration> "
Example : ./oss -n 5 -s 3 -t 7

->This command will launch oss with 5 total children, allow a maximum of 3 children to run simultaneously
,and specify 7 iterations per child.

Cleaning Up: 
To remove the compiled executables, use the following command:
 type "make clean" This will delete the oss and user executables.

Challenges:

Since this was a first project and professor mark had uploaded few resources to complete this project, I felt pretty comfortable on finishing this project.
